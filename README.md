**Plexflix** is a dockerized personal media managing and streaming solution for Plex libraries hosted on Google Drive.

### Requirements

- [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)

### Services

- **Plex** - Manages and streams media.
- **Plexdrive** - Mounts a read-only, Google Drive account as a fuse filesystem that is optimized for media playback.

## Installation

1. Install fuse on your system (optional).
2. Create a `.env` file using [`.env.example`](.env.example) as a reference: `cp -n .env{.example,}`.
3. Create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file using [docker-compose.override.example.yml](docker-compose.override.example.yml) as a reference: `cp -n docker-compose.override{.example,}.yml`.
4. Build the Plexflix docker images by running `make build`.
5. Create the Plexdrive configuration files by running `make plexdrive-setup` and following the prompts.
6. Create a `.mountcheck` file on Google Drive. This file will tell Plexflix your mount is healthy.

## Setup

When running the Plexflix for the first time, after doing a `make up`:

1. Configure Plex Media Server by visiting `http://<YOUR_IP>:<PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER_PORT>/web`.

## Usage

To start the collection:

```
make up
```

To stop the collection:

```
make down
```

To view logs:

```
make logs [service="<service>"] [file=/path/to/log/file]
```

To build docker images:

```
make build
```

To remove docker images:

```
make clean
```

To see the health of your Plexdrive mount:

```
make mount-health
```

## FAQ

If you get an error such as `..is mounted on /Users but it is not a shared mount...` run `make fuse-shared-mount dir=/Users` where `dir` is your root directory.

If you get an error such as `...mount: /host_mnt/dir: not mount point or bad option...` turn off `Use gRPC FUSE for file sharing` in your Docker preferences.
